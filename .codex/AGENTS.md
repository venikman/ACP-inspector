## Compound Codex Tool Mapping (Claude Compatibility)

This section maps Claude Code plugin tool references to Codex behavior.
Only this block is managed automatically.

Tool mapping:
- Read: use shell reads (cat/sed) or rg
- Write: create files via shell redirection or apply_patch
- Edit/MultiEdit: use apply_patch
- Bash: use shell_command
- Grep: use rg (fallback: grep)
- Glob: use rg --files or find
- LS: use ls via shell_command
- WebFetch/WebSearch: use curl or Context7 for library docs
- AskUserQuestion/Question: ask the user in chat
- Task/Subagent/Parallel: run sequentially in main thread; use multi_tool_use.parallel for tool calls
- TodoWrite/TodoRead: use file-based todos in todos/ with file-todos skill
- Skill: open the referenced SKILL.md and follow it
- ExitPlanMode: ignore
